#Post Analysis Questions
1.Clearly mention and explain the preprocessing phase. Why did you choose a
particular pre-processing step?
We chose to preprocess the text by removing stopwords and punctuation, and then performing stemming because it reduces the dimensionality of the feature space and removes noise from the text.

2.Explain your choice of model and why do you think it performs well?
We chose the Random Forest model because it is a robust and versatile algorithm that can handle high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships between features. It also performs well on imbalanced datasets.
